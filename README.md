Bsides Brisbane 2021/2022 released a badge that appears to be a Synthesizer to align with this years theme of retro synthwave. This repo will be a collection of research on what the features of the badge are and how to use it.

Thankfully the badge came with a 3.5mm male to male cable and a 9v battery. I was able to connect this to an external speaker and play around making noises.

</div>

The inputs are a 16 mini push switches, these have corresponding surface LED's, when pressing the switches on rows 1 and 3 the LED with the switch would turn on. Interestingly the switches on row 2 or 4 have the the LED in the opposite column. Switch bottom rights is Labelled SW16, the LED bottom Left is labelled D16 and turns on when the SW16 switch is activated.

There are 6 potentiometers to adust various settings. I have no idea what any of these mean but I've Used [Roland - A to Z of Synth terms](https://rolandcorp.com.au/blog/a-to-z-synthesizer) to put together the following table.

|  Label  |  Full Name  |  Description  | Plain English |
|---------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| Coarse Pitch | aka Coarse Tune | This is used to adjust the pitch in semitone steps | No bloomin idea |
| Filter Peak | | Filter used to eliminate the highest sound pressure levels | Removes the top end? |
| ENV Attack | Envelope Attach| The first stage in the ADSR sound ENVELOPE, which describes how a sound varies with time. When the envelope controls the AMPLIFIER (VCA), the attack is the time it takes for the start of the sound to reach its maximum volume. | A xylophone has a short attack as you can hear the maximum volume of the sound immediately as the mallet strikes the bar whereas a woodwind has a slower attack as it takes a longer time for air to move through the instrument. |
| Double | | ?? Pass | ?? Still Pass |
| ENV Mod | Envelope Modulation | A method that uses CONTROL VOLTAGE to add movement and expression to a sound. A VOLTAGE is applied by either a physical action or electronically. Voltage is applied to a parameter that then oscillates the signalâ€™s PITCH, FILTER or GAIN. | |
| ENV Release | Envelope Release | The fourth and last stage in the ADSR sound ENVELOPE, which describes how a sound varies with time. When the envelope controls the AMPLIFIER (VCA), the release is the time it takes for the end of the sound to reach its minimum volume. | |

</div>

#### Audio Out

Appears to be a simple mono 3.5mm output for headphones or a speaker.

#### CV Out - Control Voltage Out

used by ANALOG synthesizers to control the OSCILLATORS, FILTERS, ENVLEOPES and other components.

#### Gate Out

A signal that can turn on and off; ON when holding down a key, OFF when releasing the key. A gate signal can turn a note on or off, change the stages of an ENVELOPE or start/stop a SEQUENCE. Can also refer to a DYNAMIC effect that cuts off a sound below a certain decibel level.

</div>

There is a Jumper/Socket labelled J5. I suspect that this is used to program the board. The pins are as follows:

**MISO** - Master In Slave Out
**VCC** - Voltage at the Common Collector
**SCK** - Serial Clock
**MOSI** - Master Out Slave In
**RST** - Reset/Restart
**GND** - Ground

### Chips
There are two onboard chips on the board labelled U1 and U2. So far I've been able 

U1 - 6209 A940/50
U2 - Atmel MEGA328PB 204030
